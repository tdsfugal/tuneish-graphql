# How it all got started

A long time ago, when I was a single and living in Berlin, I used to spend a lot of time in jazz clubs. One night (well, technically early morning), after the after-party ended, I thought,

"This looks like fun. I should learn to play something."

My first idea was a piano, but when I realized what it would cost to ship it back to the 'States, I settled on a cheap bass and a tiny practice amp. Despite the language barrier, I signed up for bass lessons. My bass teacher was very patient, but I'm sure he thought I was a moron. One of his favorite sayings was, in broken English, "Practice this all over the fretboard, and in every key."

Ok, fine, but the fretboard is blank except for a few dots. What is a key? Where are the keys? Heck, where are the notes?!? He would play very slowly and say, "Es ist ganz einfach, pass auf meine Finger auf," but his fingers didn't have labels either so that didn't help much. There were flashbacks to my performance in fourth grade math.

_"You, in the back. Yes, you. The one wearing paisley on class picture day. Quickly, what is 7 times 6?" All eyes turn to me, "Um, quickly it's 42." The whole class starts laughing..._

By far his best piece of advice was, "If you want to play jazz, learn to walk bass lines. Follow the circle of fifths like you're going home." I thought, I'm in Germany, home is far, far away, and what is this frick'n circle of fifths he keeps talking about?

I knew then what I had to do.

I went online and bought chord and scale books, in English. I bought a clever paper wheel that I could dial to see the scales. I bought a metronome. I made flash cards. I practiced every scale, all over the keyboard. I learned chord forms. I learned most of the notes. After a lot of time and effort I had better skills, and a lot more stuff, but I still got lost. All the pieces were there, but they were just pieces.

As I got better, an image began to form in my head of what would have been nice when I was starting out. It was a cool animated fretboard with an associated circle of fifths. I could use it to practice scales. I could use it to practice chords. And most importantly, I could use it to see why different chords fit together to create harmony. It would be detailed enough to show me - in real-time - where I was musically, where home was, where I should go next, and most importantly, why.

So I built it.

Tuneish has practice pages for bass and guitar. There is a circle of fifths. Click on it to set the key. There is a simple chord picker. Use it to see where the chords are on the circle and the fretboard. Soon there will be a chromatic display like a piano keyboard, to see the intervals of the key and chord.

I play fretless most of the time, so I integrated a tuner with the app. That's good enough for tuning, setup, and checking intonation while playing my fretless bass slowly. (If I'm really off, it shows me the note I am actually playing, which is cool too.) It would be cool if it could sense all the notes in a chord at once, but the simple algorithm that is there now can only sense clear, single note tones. Upgrading the tuner is one of the many things on my to-do list for tuneish.

My dream for tuneish is to help every lost music student make sense of music theory. I have plans to add other instrument types, and support for rhythm and melody too. Check back every now and then to see how it is progressing.

Please enjoy my creation. If you like it, share it with your friends. If you really like it, please donate. The servers don't pay for themselves.

## Why Tuneish?

Every tune is a story created by humans. Musicians tell their stories with rhythm, harmony, melody, and sometimes lyrics, but they are still relating their human experiences in a way that other humans can understand. Music has heart, and it has soul. No web site can give you that.

Tunish is intended to help you visualize music theory as you tell your story. It doesn't make tunes, but it is tune-ish.
