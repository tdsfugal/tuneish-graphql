# gql-lessons

This graphql service manages lessons.

A _lesson_ is a set of objects on the home page that constitute a discrete lesson. They will generally include some sheet music, an instrument represenation, possibly a circle of fifths, and a bouncing-ball chord chart. Or nothing.

_Lessons_ may be assigned by one user to another. The standard CRUD operations are associated with priviledges that may be granted or revoked by the owner.
